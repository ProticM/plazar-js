The framework itself has no dependencies and by leaning on Object-Oriented-Principles (OOP) it can easily be used to create a large Single-Page Application or it can be integrated to a portion of a web page where dynamic workflow is required. It is written in plain JavaScript and built to be flexible. For example, in ReactJS everything is JavaScript, and Angular has a forceful opinion about how your application should be constructed. PlazarJS is designed to help you build the application the way you want it without forcing you to follow a path you do not think is suitable for the application you are developing. The main focus is on good old trio, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</div>',
