It's leaning on Object-Oriented-Principles (OOP) and it's build with plain JavaScript and you should feel free to use it on every device where JavaScript is supported, which is literally every device alive &#x263A; The framework it self has no dependencies (Hooray &#x263A;) and was built by a JavaScript lover/enthusiast with a strong desire to make this development world a better place.",
