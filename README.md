  <p align="center">
Is a versatile framework build to enrich developers expirience in terms of simplicity and speed of application development. 
It's leaning on Object-Oriented-Principles (OOP) and it's build with plain JavaScript and you should feel free to use it on every device where JavaScript is supported, which is literally every device alive &#x263A; The framework it self has no dependencies (Hooray &#x263A;) and was built by a JavaScript lover/enthusiast with a strong desire to make this development world a better place.

## Getting Started and Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found <a href="http://www.plazarjs.com">here</a>.

## Deploy

plazar-js uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build tool. Run the following task to deploy the source into `dist`.

```
$ gulp build
```

## Bugs and Issues

1. A bug is taken into account only if it can be reproduced on the latest master.
2. Open an issue on GitHub to request a fix.

## Browser Support

plazar-js supports all latest web and mobile browsers.

#### IE Browser Support

1. Usage under version 10 is not recommended.
2. Every implementation/change is done in a way to ignore IE version 9 and lower.

## Plans

Some of the next major releases would be:

1. Core plazar-ui (set of controls out of the box). This will eliminate the need for any external CSS framework integration. Of course, you would still be able to integrate any of them if you choose so.
2. Typescript support.
