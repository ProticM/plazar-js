# plazar-js

PlazarJS is a versatile framework build to enrich developers expirience in terms of simplicity and speed of application development. 
It\'\s leaning on Object-Oriented-Principles (OOP) and it\'\s build with plain JavaScript and you should feel free to use it on every device where
JavaScript is supported, which is literally every device alive &#x263A;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The framework it self has no dependencies (Hooray &#x263A;) and was built by a 
JavaScript lover/enthusiast with a strong desire to make this development world a better place.
